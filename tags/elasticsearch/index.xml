      <description>Ladies and Gentlemen, the 14th October is not only the date of our next meetup, but is exactly one year to the day since we had our Inaugural meetup to discuss if the group was worth forming. It was a small affair with about 6 of us upstairs at the Brewery Tap (infact we shared the room with Leeds Alopicia society separated by only a curtain). There was a general consensus that the group had a future, we then drank beer, and talked about devops, file systems and quadcopters, the rest is history.</description>
