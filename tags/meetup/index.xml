      <description>Ladies and Gentlemen, the 14th October is not only the date of our next meetup, but is exactly one year to the day since we had our Inaugural meetup to discuss if the group was worth forming. It was a small affair with about 6 of us upstairs at the Brewery Tap (infact we shared the room with Leeds Alopicia society separated by only a curtain). There was a general consensus that the group had a future, we then drank beer, and talked about devops, file systems and quadcopters, the rest is history.</description>

      <description>This month we&#39;ll be at the Open Data Institute Leeds Node. Situated just around the corner from the BBC, Aagrah and the Wardrobe at the top of Munro House. We decide we should really get somewhere that had space for us all (last month at the Adelphi was a little too &#34;cosy&#34;). So we have a great venue with a nice big screen, plenty of seating and panic not - a bar.</description>
