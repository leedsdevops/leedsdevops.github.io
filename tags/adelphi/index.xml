      <description>The great Ben Rockwood tells us Beer is an essential devops tool. With this in mind as we approach the festive season, we thought as there was no meetup planned this month we should&amp;nbsp;have a few celebratory ales.So thanks to the very nice chaps over at DigitaLeeds they have let us gatecrash their xmas shin dig along with new friends from Leeds PHP and the Northern UX group.
The format of the evening is very simple, drink and chat, no talks, speakers or agenda.</description>
