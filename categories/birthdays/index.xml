      <description>Well it&#39;s our first birthday, how time flies when you&#39;re having fun.It&#39;s hard for us to get our tiny brains around just how far we&#39;ve come in such a short period of time. We put the site together and grabbed our @LeedsDevops twitter handle and we were off...
We are indebted to those who have supported us throughout the year from local groups and business&#39; and we&#39;ve had some great meetups.</description>
