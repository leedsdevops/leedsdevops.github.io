      <description>We sat down and said &#34;we need a mission statement, a manifesto, something that describes to newcomers what Devops is. At the same time it mustn&#39;t be too dumbed down for those who have been practicing the craft for years&#34; - easy ? Nope. We realised that whenever anyone describes Devops they almost always start be saying what it isn&#39;t.
There are loads of definitions all written from differing view points, be it a Developer, a Sys Admin or Management, all have their own spin.</description>

      <description>In a single day we&#39;ve hit 50 followers on the @leedsdevops twitter account. Which is loads more than we ever expected - so thank you!
One very good question posed by @CraigPickles was...
 @leedsDevops so what exactly is your aim/ambition for this group/gathering? #intrigued
 The assumption we&#39;ve made here is that everyone already has basic understanding of what DevOps is and the kind of culture, skills and tools that it embraces.</description>

      <description>Ok, so we&#39;re looking for...
Voices - to promote this group to whoever and however you can, but twitter might be a simple starting point, please retweet stuff.
Hands - to help run the group, from posting stuff to twitter or tumblr, to organising meetups.
Sponsors - we don&#39;t need a huge amount of cash, just enough to pay for the hire of the function room at a pub in Leeds, maybe a bit extra for a bite to eat and Beer.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Leeds DevOps, the home of what we hope will become a hub for everyone in Leeds and the surrounding area with an interest in all things DevOps.
Whether you a Developer or in Operations (or both!)&amp;nbsp;you&#39;re welcome to exchange ideas, tools, working practices or cultural shifts. Be that on here or via @leedsdevops let&#39;s get together and start sharing stuff.
The plan is to have a monthly meetup in the format of the existing groups in Leeds (@leedsphp, @leedsdatathing, node up north etc), where there is a presentation on a tool/idea/culture, followed by a healthy discussion possibly over a beer (or two).</description>
