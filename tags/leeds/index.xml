      <description>Ladies and gentlemen, we are delighted to announce we have teamed up with the folks over at Technology UG to bring a day of Devops talks to Leeds. Their event on on 22nd October 2015 will feature talks about storage, virtualisation, data centers and now Devops.
We&#39;ve been asked to curate a devops track at the event and rather than being a &#34;LeedsDevops greatest hits&#34; we&#39;ve pulled together a fantastic line up, which in our opinion wouldn&#39;t look out of place at any international devops conference.</description>

      <description>Ladies and Gentlemen, it&#39;s with great pride we announce our new group sponsor.To date, our meetup events have been sponsored on an ahdoc basis by numerous companies affiliated to our speakers or invited at our discretion.
We have been looking for a regular sponsor, but wanted to make sure they were in line with our ethos and had the objectives of the group at heart, we didn&#39;t simply want to side with a company that wanted to sell stuff, we wanted a sponsor that closely understood our values and what we are about.</description>

      <description>This month we&#39;ll be at the Open Data Institute Leeds Node. Situated just around the corner from the BBC, Aagrah and the Wardrobe at the top of Munro House. We decide we should really get somewhere that had space for us all (last month at the Adelphi was a little too &#34;cosy&#34;). So we have a great venue with a nice big screen, plenty of seating and panic not - a bar.</description>

      <description>Last week we presented a &#34;DevOps 101&#34; talk to the fine people over at Agile Yorkshire.
http://www.agileyorkshire.org/event-announcements/11thfebsebroseandbadtestgoodtestandyburginwithadevops101
We covered some of the &#34;classic&#34; definitions of DevOps from Adam Jacobs, John Willis and Damon Edwards, although the slightly sweary version from @lusis was perhaps the most well received.
We discussed the history of the movement and the principles it builds upon from Systems Thinking, Therory of Constraints and Lean, including a detailed look at how those are applied to CAMS (Culture, Automation, Measurement and Sharing).</description>

      <description>The third meet up of LeedsDevops took place at Leeds Central on Tuesday 14th January. We&#39;d sold out the 25 tickets on eventbrite and we maybe could have had a few more people in the venue, so next time we&#39;ll look for a bigger venue.After a quick recap of the groups aims and objective we had an insightful talk from Robin Harvey who is currently contracting at Orange Digital. He ran through his experiences of Devops and detailed the issues created by&amp;nbsp;the fast evolution of cloud services.</description>

      <description>Even after releasing another 5 tickets for the meetup yesterday, we&#39;ve still managed to give away 12 tickets yesterday - Big thank you folks, we&#39;re really chuffed.
We&#39;ve added a waitlist to the eventbrite page so if you still want to come but didn&#39;t manage to get a ticket put your name down and w can let you know if there are any cancellations.
If we get a big enough waitlist by Friday then we may&amp;nbsp;need to look at getting a bigger venue.</description>
