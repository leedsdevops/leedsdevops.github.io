      <description>Ladies and gentlemen, we are delighted to announce we have teamed up with the folks over at Technology UG to bring a day of Devops talks to Leeds. Their event on on 22nd October 2015 will feature talks about storage, virtualisation, data centers and now Devops.
We&#39;ve been asked to curate a devops track at the event and rather than being a &#34;LeedsDevops greatest hits&#34; we&#39;ve pulled together a fantastic line up, which in our opinion wouldn&#39;t look out of place at any international devops conference.</description>
